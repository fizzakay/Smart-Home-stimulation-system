# SHF Smart Home Simulation System

Welcome to the **SHF Smart Home Simulation System**, an interactive C++ project that simulates a smart home environment. This system allows users to control smart devices like lights and thermostats while demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including:

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

---

## üìù Summary

The project demonstrates a basic smart home simulation where users can:

- Turn devices on/off
- Adjust brightness levels for lights
- Set the temperature for thermostats

It is a console-based system that utilizes C++ classes and menus to interact with the user.
