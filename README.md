# Smart-Energy Optimizer

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Smart-Energy Optimizer is an AI-powered system that analyzes energy usage patterns in smart homes and recommends real-time optimizations to reduce electricity consumption and costs. It integrates with IoT sensors to suggest personalized energy-saving actions.

## Background

Rising electricity prices and increasing environmental awareness have made energy efficiency a global concern. Many households struggle to monitor or optimize their energy usage effectively.

* Wastage due to unnecessary usage of appliances
* Lack of real-time feedback on energy consumption
* Inability to manually control multiple devices efficiently

This project is personally motivated by a need to lower energy bills in my community and contribute to sustainability using AI automation.

## How is it used?

The system runs as a background service in a smart home environment, collecting data from:

* Smart meters
* Light sensors
* Thermostats
* Appliance usage logs

Users interact with the system through a mobile dashboard or voice commands. The system:

* Sends alerts about excessive energy use
* Suggests optimal times to run high-consumption devices
* Automatically adjusts lighting or heating based on room occupancy

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data Sources:**

* Historical electricity usage data
* Weather data (API-based)
* Real-time sensor input from IoT devices

**AI Methods:**

* Time-series forecasting using LSTM
* Reinforcement learning for adaptive device control
* Clustering algorithms to group user behavior patterns

## Challenges

* Privacy concerns when collecting personal home usage data
* Not all homes are equipped with smart sensors or IoT devices
* Variability in electricity pricing models across regions
* Requires reliable internet for real-time updates

## What next?

The next steps include:

* Integrating solar panel and battery storage data
* Adding support for demand-response programs from local utilities
* Partnering with home automation vendors to embed the optimizer
* Creating a user-friendly app for non-technical households

I would need assistance in:

* UI/UX design for non-technical users
* Backend cloud deployment
* Further training of machine learning models on large-scale data
